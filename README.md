# BlindsAid-Project
**Problem Statement :** Focused on visually impaired individuals (Blind people) in detecting and recognizing people/objects in their surroundings via Spectacles.

**Overview:** Our projectâ€™s ideal concept is based on Image Recognition.
Our system is simply configured with Raspberry Pi, AI/ML Modules, Camera and the Bluetooth earphones. The mini camera identifies, captures and sends the image to the chip integrated within. The chip then processes image and searches the image in the already available dataset.
If found, then details of the object or person is sent in a mp3 format to the microphone through which a user can hear them.

**Description :** The Blinds Aid project aims to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals by developing smart glasses integrated with computer vision and deep learning technology. 
These glasses help detect and recognize people in the surroundings, addressing the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in navigating and engaging in social interactions. 
By utilizing a combination of hardware component. The successful implementation of the Blinds Aid project has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals, fostering inclusivity and accessibility in their daily interactions. 

**Phase 1**
**Planning and Analysis**
1. Idea was inspired by the movie IRON-MAN, his Sunglasses (EDITH).
2. Thought we can utilize these glasses to help blind people
3. To assist them via camera and Audio
4. It has Hardware and Software but committed to design and develop software in the phase 1

**Requirements Analysis**
1. Studying what all the requirements needed to develop this project
2. Analysing its feasibility

**Design and Develop**
1. Development of Software to detect the objects
2. Enhancement of Live Video Object Detection
3. Collecting the images and Training the Dataset
4. Uploading the dataset and running the program.

**Testing and Analysis**
1. Testing of the code to detect the objects
2. Debugging errors in it

**Final Software**
Final prototyope. 


**Phase 1**
